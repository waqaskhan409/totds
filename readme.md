**All the chat data will be recieving in JSON format.**

It's Assignment of **Tools and techniques in Datascience** where we need to manage the data from socket and REST APIs. 
For this assignment I've used couple of things.
I'm using Express.js/Node.js for managing data as a microservice or middleware between structure data and unstructure data. 

Requirement for installing this is:
  1. First thing first, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) intalled
  2. Then, intall [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) on the top [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for managing data and creating socket and REST APIs.
  2. Create static html page to user can POST the chat or retrieve the chat. 
  3. Download CouchDB Server and install it system. Set adminname as admin and password as 12345.
  4. Then, All setup. Enjoy chat app.
